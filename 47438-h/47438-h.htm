<span class="largecap">T</span>WO years sufficed to exhaust the sixth
edition (the first shilling one) of my
"Elementary Instruction on Illuminating,"
in opposition, too, of a rival
author; who was, however, more fortunate&mdash;for he
was enabled to <i>illuminate</i> the world, with seven consecutive
editions in as many months, and left the world
for two years after in as much darkness as ever.&mdash;Far
from envying him this inordinate success, I rest secure
on my laurels, humble though they be.&mdash;Ten years were
needed to bring forth my seventh edition, and here it
is&mdash;as unpretending as ever&mdash;but fully understood,
and understandable&mdash;no new theories erudite in
print and bad in practice&mdash;no old ones, filched from
musty manuscripts, alike impracticable as complicated,
and displayed with learning and research, to bolster
up repute and attach importance to very questionable
utility; wholly unimportant to those who seek information.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
I address the <i>few</i> and the few only, who
will take practical hints, from a practical man, clothed
in the plainest English. I do not trade on other men's
brains, but endeavour to live by my own. Those who
encourage the empiric in art must buy experience,
and be contented with their shillings worth.(?) I
have added only some additional matter on colours
and composition, as applied to illumination, which I
hope the public may find useful&mdash;in other respects
the seventh edition is like its predecessors&mdash;a
claimant to public favour.</p>

copies of which are now sold), has induced me to re-publish
it, under the present less expensive form, in
order to keep pace with the many publications which,
under the names of "Manuals," "Primers," "Treatises,"
"Guides," and "Instruction Books," have lately
been forced on the public notice, each pretending to
give the desired information to the followers of this
beautiful art, with more or less display of talent; but
all tending towards the cultivation of a highly interesting
pursuit, and proving that the nineteenth
century may in future history be distinguished as
having produced a "style" of its own, and identifying
it with the happy and peaceful reign of "Victoria,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
under whose mild rule, arts and civilization are so
eminently flourishing. The perusal, however, of these
various publications has confirmed me in the conviction,
that, for the purposes of instruction, the plan
originally carried out by me was best fitted to achieve
the object in view, my aim being to <i>instruct in</i>, and
not to <i>lecture on</i> the art. I have, therefore, studiously
divested the present publication of technicalities, or of
any attempt to display learned research, in the origin
or progress of the art, which, to the uninitiated, would
not be instructive, and could only prove "caviare to
the general." My long professional experience as a
practical artist, has induced me to clothe, in the
plainest language, the information I wished to convey;
and, in common English, endeavour to speak to the
understanding of my readers. If, therefore, the present
volume prove continuously useful, as it has hitherto
been, my readers will absolve me from blame or
egotism, in thus adhering to my original plan; my care
having been not to fall into the error of my contemporary
imitators. All I have ventured to add, is
such information as my continued practical experience
has enabled me to collect, and I cheerfully communicate
it to my readers.</p>

<span class="largecap">T</span>HE beautiful "Art of Illuminating,"
which sprang up with the early dawn
of Christianity, and attained its highest
perfection in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, owes its total extinction to that
powerful instrument of modern civilisation, the
Printing Press. Whether it be the phlegmatic Dutch
Coster, or the German Necromancer, Guttenberg,
who was the first inventor of "moveable type," I
know not; but it is quite certain that the "printing
process" struck a fatal and decisive blow to "illuminated
painting," the relics of which at present are
carefully hoarded up in our Museums and Public
Libraries, and are at once the living and imperishable
oracles of the bygone ages of romance and chivalry,
and form the glorious monuments of the known and
unknown artists who created them! It is equally
true, as well as curious, that to another mode of
printing (chromo-lithography) the present century is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
indebted for the partial revival of this beautiful art,
since the many publications from the lithographic
press have engendered a corresponding taste with the
public for its cultivation, which is daily increasing.
That taste is now so manifest, and so general
amongst the higher and middle classes, that it can
no longer be considered as a mere "fashionable"
pursuit, subject to the capricious ebb and flow of the
tide of fashion, and again to be doomed to pass into
oblivion. I believe a healthier motive is apparent in
its cultivators; and the desire of re-instating it to the
rank it once held amongst its sister arts is not
unmixed with the holier emotions which a genuine
religious feeling, arising from the daily contemplation
of the divine truths of Holy Writ (as exhibited in the
study of our finest missals), is capable of producing.
In this respect, it presents itself to the devout mind
of the novice as a labour of love, for the glorious
poetry of the Bible offers such a singularly fertile
source, to which the imagination and pencil may look
for artistic inspiration.</p>

<p>The seductiveness of the art, too, on which the
meanest capacity can employ itself, is another incentive,
which will cause many to venture on so
pleasing an occupation. The interesting question
then arises: What probable results are likely to
follow from this general revival of an obsolete art?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
My answer is, "That modern civilisation will adapt it
to our modern wants, and will gradually lay the
foundation of forming a <i>new school</i>, identical with
the nineteenth century." To attain this end, <i>conscientious</i>
artists only can pave the road; <i>they</i> have
it in their power to direct and guide the masses, and
the public is sure to go with them.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Illuminating Art Union of London</span>, in its
annual expositions, invites artists to exhibit their productions,
by which others less gifted may be incited
to follow their example. True Genius, however exalted,
does not feel itself above instructing others, as
long as through the medium of its productions the
very best interests of the art are likely to be promoted.
Gradually, these productions will develop
new ideas, new resources, and features of originality,
in addition to the improvements which modern civilisation
and modern appliances necessarily suggest.
Already three prizes have been awarded for original
designs of the "Beatitudes"; and, as a first essay
of a young Society, they are eminently creditable.
The highest in the land, and, perhaps, the humblest
also, are its members and supporters; and
however the effort to increase its strength and its popularity
might have been thwarted, by the lukewarmness
of those professedly the most interested in the art,
we owe it a debt of profound gratitude, for the real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
good it has already achieved, and cheerfully join our
wishes for its welfare and success in what it still
hopes to accomplish.</p>

<p>A tendency to undermine the best interests of the
art is, however, insidiously at work to misguide the
public taste. The hired pen of the unprincipled and
unskilful scribbler has been used by mere traders, to
advertise <i>their own materials</i>, and bring into notice
<i>worthless designs for illuminating</i>; the former without
the slightest regard to their adaptability for the purposes
of "missal painting," and the latter without the
least pretence to artistic merit. Unscrupulous authors
have been found to dictate "rules" for instruction,
when, practically, they require <i>instruction</i> themselves,
judging from the ignorance they display in their own
pages. These very books, miscalled "Guides" and
Outlines, facetiously named "Useful Models," have
received, in their turn, fulsome praise in the pages of
those, whose talents (to their shame be it written) as
illuminators are unquestionable, and whose commendations,
though valuable (?) in a <i>trading sense</i>,
are sadly detrimental to the interests of those who
seek for information and instruction.</p>

<p>It is, however, to be hoped that a discriminating
public, whose taste in <i>Missal Painting and Illuminating</i>
has become considerably enlightened and developed
of late years, by the daily contemplation of, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
familiarity with, the works of our greatest masters,
(owing to the great liberality displayed by the trustees
of the British Museum, in throwing open, without
reserve, for daily inspection, the glowing vellums contained
in its various collections, together with the
publication of such immortal works as the "Hours
of Anna Brittanny" published in Paris, etc., etc.)
will be enabled to discern the <i>useful</i> from the worthless,
and separate the <i>gold</i> from the <i>dross</i>.</p>

</span>
<span class="largecap">T</span>HE necessity for an "Elementary Instruction
Book," to acquire the art of
illuminating on vellum, for the use of
those who are desirous of practising
this beautiful and graceful accomplishment, has
long since become imperative; particularly since, to
my own knowledge, several handbooks have made
their appearance, professedly with the object of
affording instruction to the many amateur artists, who
eagerly seek for such information in the first one
that is presented to them by the bookseller; and it
often happens, that such books, by their high sounding
titles, deceive both the vendor and purchaser.
The subsequent disappointment to the latter may be
easily imagined, when, instead of the "instruction"
anxiously looked for, he finds an elaborate treatise
"<i>cut short</i>" on the plea "<i>of the necessary limits of the
little work</i>," etc; and then only obtains snatches of
information of extraordinary existing specimens to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
found in the various libraries of Europe, to which
he can have <i>no</i> access; interlarded with "technical
phrases," of which he can have <i>no</i> idea, and elaborate
fragments of ornamentation, illustrative of the author's
text, but without affording him the slightest clue what
to do with them, or how, in his experience, he can
apply them to a useful purpose. The disappointed
amateur artist, therefore, turns away and feels himself
sadly at a loss for some aid in his endeavour to pursue
a most beautiful, and, at the same time, easy
accomplishment, simply from the fact of unexplained
difficulties having been thrown in his path; for
though specimens of illuminations have from time to
time been published, from which the student may
have derived some slight advantage,&mdash;if only a superficial
insight into style and taste,&mdash;yet they are universally
of too elaborate a character to be of much utility
to the beginner; and in the attempt to copy such
specimens as Noel Humphreys has published in his
"Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages," the pupil
frequently must become embarrassed by the intricacy
of the design; and not knowing any method <i>where</i>
to commence or <i>how</i> to proceed, would, in attempting
such specimens, make such signal failures, that in
despair he would throw his work aside, and for ever
abandon an art, which, simple and highly interesting
in itself, would by him be considered at once as futile
and impracticable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
The beauty of illuminated drawing consists chiefly
in the <i>nicety</i> of execution, elaborate ornamental detail,
and the mathematical precision with which ornaments
are frequently repeated throughout the same design.
The arrangement of colours requires also much judgment
and taste, whilst the knowledge how to lay them
on evenly and smoothly, requires the practical instruction
of the teacher, without whom it is almost
impossible to overcome these difficulties, or acquire
proficiency, particularly in <i>raised gilding</i>, and the
nicety which is required in using the agate, with
which the ornamentations are engraved on matted
gold or silver.</p>

<p>As an art, which originated at the remotest period
of Christianity, and which originally was practised by
very limited artistic intelligence, its first development
was exceedingly simple, crude, and grotesque. When
the rolled papyrus manuscripts were superseded by
squares of parchment, in the form of our present
books, the Scribes or Monks of the early Christian
period were the first who were engaged in the writing
of prayer-books or missals for the wealthier classes
of people, who at that time were alone enabled to
indulge in the luxury of a book; it is then we find
the first germs of artistic composition displayed, in
the initial letters which began to be conspicuously
large and ornamental, fanciful, and sometimes intricately
and ingeniously contrived, in contradistinction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
to the older rolled manuscripts discovered
in Herculaneum and Pompeii, in which no traces of
ornamentation could be found. From this simple
source of artistic development, we may contrast the
productions of Giulio Clovio of a much later period,
and his many and unknown contemporaries, who have
astonished the world by productions, unequalled by
anything that modern art could achieve. As I shall
have occasion to speak of the progress of illuminating,
and ornamental art, in a separate work about to be
published, I merely hint here, at the commencement,
that, for modern purposes of illumination, it would be
highly pedantic to copy the earlier productions of
missal painting, merely because they are antique, if in
other respects they do not possess some artistic quality
of graceful development both in outline and colouring,
to which the modern artist may, with very good taste,
give preference.</p>

<p>The object of this little work is not so much to
enter into any detailed history of the progress of
ornamental art, which may well become a separate
and intricate study, as to smooth down the difficult
path of the beginner, to unravel for him apparent
mysteries in the art, to give him examples of practical
designs to imitate from, suitable to his skill; to point
out to him clearly and unmistakeably such rules as,
from my experience, I have found absolutely necessary
to adopt, and which if studiously followed up will,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
in a great measure, assist his first efforts and enhance
his ultimate success and proficiency.</p>

<p>That which is most remarkable in those mediæval
vellum-illuminations which have been preserved in
the various collections of Europe, is the brilliancy of
their colours, tints unsurpassed by anything that our
modern contrivances can equal, or our colour-box
approach. Specimens which have stood the test of
a thousand years' duration, are as fresh and as brilliant
as if they came newly from the artist's hands.
Such <i>orange</i>, and such <i>greens</i>, and <i>purples</i>, as if
directly snatched and stolen from the rainbow itself,
or distilled from the prismatic rays of a benignant
sun. The borders are actually studded with gems of
colour which sparkle on the insects as if they were
photographed from nature, colours as well as form.
Drapery, damask, armoury, furs, and feathers, are all
portrayed in such rich and gorgeous tints, that we may
well doubt whether the secret of these colours has not
died with those who used them centuries ago. Our
water-colours were as brickdust at the side of them.
In order somewhat to remedy the deficiency of our
colours (as I found them) in comparison with what
was desirable, the attempt has been made to manufacture
them on a new principle, in order to preserve
all the brightness of the chief tints predominant in
illuminations; and I am happy to say, that, after
years of experience, I have entirely succeeded in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
producing a set of colours suitable for the purposes
of illumination; and I now beg to recommend to my
pupils and readers those only called "Illuminating
Colours." Chemically speaking, they are manufactured
on a totally distinct principle from other water-colours,
and are made to answer all the purposes of
illuminated drawing, affording perfect facility on the
one hand in laying them on evenly and smoothly,
and, on the other, saving a great deal of time and
labour, and enhancing much the general effect of the
design, in the <i>brilliancy</i> of the tints; this refers more
particularly to their use when applied to vellum, which
from its greasy surface is apt to reject the <i>usual water-colours</i>,
whilst those of the illuminating-box are found
perfectly to answer the purpose. I beg also to recommend
the "water gold-size," which in its application
to the drawing, can be raised considerably above its
surface, assuming all the appearance of being embossed,
and can be <i>immediately</i> gilded over, which
greatly expedites the process over that of any other
gold varnish.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>That persons having a knowledge of drawing can
and will make better illuminators than those who
have not, there can be no doubt; and the more
accomplished the artist, the better illuminator he will
make is also obvious. Yet the art of illumination
may be practised by persons who may be but indifferent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
artists in general design, and with a great
deal of success; whilst others, conversant with the
highest principles of art, have frequently been found
to be but very indifferent illuminators. The reason
of this is apparent; illuminating being for the most
part a strictly mechanical art (though subject to
artistic principles), any one possessed of natural gifts
of taste, patience and perseverance, will, by studiously
following out some slight mechanical contrivances,
easily attain the first principles primarily
necessary to copy any given outline however intricate;
not even excluding the human figure.</p>

<p>The ornamental arabesque scroll, from its primitive
simplicity to the most elaborately finished foliage,
interlaced initials, etc., are given in due succession
for the pupil to copy; by which means his hand
becomes gradually trained to curval delineations, and
his eyes get by degrees educated, till at last all
angular tendency in his ornamentations is entirely
eradicated. Once trained to that perfection, colouring
and shading become comparatively easy, and a little
instruction, with practice, will enable the hitherto
uneducated artist to overcome almost every obstacle.
The free-hand artist, on the other hand, relying on
his capacity alone, and disregarding the mechanical
contrivances at his command, not unfrequently stumbles
over the easiest parts, pettishly condemns all
such appliances, the neglect of which destroys the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
uniformity and mathematical precision of his work, and
finally he leaves off, disgusted with his ill success.</p>

<p>I would, therefore, recommend first of all to the
pupil to provide himself with a box of Illuminating
Colours, which can be obtained of the author, or at
any of the authors agents, which also includes compasses,
parallel rule, ruling-pen, agate, gold, etc., and
other little but indispensable tools; without which
the student would be at a loss to proceed. Having
procured these, I would then place this book in his
hand, and, by following up the rules laid down here
he will find himself, at least, enabled to make such
progress, that, with the aid of one or two courses of
instruction from a proper and experienced artist, he
will completely overcome those difficulties which it
would be vain to struggle against by himself. The
manuscript room in the British Museum, to which, on
a proper recommendation, access can be had, will
finally give him an opportunity of studying the art
more fully, and make him conversant with the immense
store of mediæval treasures hoarded up there
in endless variety and profusion.</p>

let them be, therefore, contented
to copy first, before attempting
<i>original</i> designs,&mdash;it will give them
experience and method. In the higher walks of
art, copying is always resorted to; the painter
has models, casts, and drapery to guide him, and
Nature is his instructor; and let him be ever so
original, he still imitates nature. Now, since there
are no ornamentations in nature to guide our illuminating
art-student, let him be content to copy, first,
from those whose works are acceptable for their
originality, their effect, and their classical beauty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
The more these are studied and copied from, the
nearer the pupil will arrive at perfection, and may
gradually become an original artist himself.</p>

<hr class="deco"/>

<p>In commencing a subject, it is absolutely necessary
first to arrange a rough design of the intended subject;
to perfect a sketch, and then to make careful
and correct tracings of the various parts (if the
design is a subject of repetition), or the whole; to
retrace them to the vellum, or Bristol board, with
the red prepared paper, as faintly as is consistent with
being able to see it. This is accomplished by placing
the red paper between the tracing and the vellum, or
drawing board, and following its outline rather briskly
with a fine pointed <span class="smcap">H H H</span> lead pencil, reversing the
tracing when the ornament or border forms the counterpart
of the design, which secures a perfect facsimile
reversed; and, when completed, repairing any
part which may be defective with the pencil, and perfecting
the outline where it is uneven, or the scrollwork
is broken or ungraceful. The beauty of illuminations is
always best secured when the scrollwork runs gracefully
smooth, not broken or angular, which gives it an
awkward and unartistic appearance. In order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
prepare the pupil, I have given, in the illustrations, the
arabesque scroll and curval lines to be drawn at the
beginning in pencil only; and when <i>form</i> is thoroughly
attained, let him re-execute it with a fine sable brush
and carmine, which will give proper practice to use
the brush effectually. I have adopted the arabesque
scroll as the principle of all ornamental design;
and I would advise the novice to practise it continually,
on the same principle that exercises and
scales are recommended in music to train the
hand.</p>

<p>Referring back to the design, when the sketch is
complete (which should always be as faint and delicate
as possible, since it is no easy matter to erase a coarse
outline from the vellum or cardboard by the usual
mode of india-rubber), the process of colouring may
then commence, by placing in the various compartments
of the design the colours as previously arranged,
somewhat in the following order, viz., first, all the blue
throughout the drawing, or any portion of it intended
for completion; then the vermilion, the orange, the
purple, the green or yellow, and any other colour
which may be in the design; next, the gold forming
the outlines of the next ornamentations; and last of
all, the shading of scrollwork, both gold and coloured,
and also the shadings on the gold backgrounds; that
being completed, you put white or gold arabesque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
ornamentations on the ultramarine, carmine damask
on the vermilions and orange, and Hooker's green or
cobalt ornamentations on the emerald. After the
whole has been thus far finished, the raised gold may
be introduced, finishing the matted or dead gold with
burnished ornamentations, dots, scrolls, arabesques,
or any other design. This should be the last process
of all, since the atmosphere is somewhat apt to
deaden its brilliancy; and, therefore, it should be the
concluding operation before the drawing is finally
consigned to the frame or album. I must here also
state, that if the vellum be somewhat soiled whilst
the drawing proceeds (which every care should
be taken to avoid, by always using a mat of blotting
paper to rest the hand on), it may be rubbed
over with a piece of stale bread, which will
perfectly cleanse it. This process, however, must
always be done before filling in the gold, silver,
or platina, as it cannot be used <i>over</i> the <i>gold</i> with
safety.</p>

<p>All straight lines, however short, should be drawn
in with the ruling-pen, opening it wider or narrowing
it, as the line is required to be thick or thin; if very
thick, rule in <i>two</i> thin lines equally distant, and then
fill up the intermediate space with the brush. A
circle, or portion of a circle, is drawn with the bow-pen;
and any portion of a curve is drawn in by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
aid of the wooden scroll, which is fixed on the
drawing in such a position, that its curve corresponds
with the outline to be ruled. The nicety
of the drawing depends entirely on the execution,
and the carefulness with which the details are
accomplished.</p>

<span class="largecap">I</span>F the observations on Colours, advanced
elsewhere, hold good, as to
their brilliancy in the mediæval missals,
the improvement which the modern
manufacturer has been able to effect is not less
apparent; for, although the mediæval productions
are mostly painted in body colours, which are
managed so exceedingly and wondrously skilfully,
with touches so light and aërial, that to the beholder
the dew-drops might almost seem capable of
being gathered from the flowers, or the "mealy" dust
brushed from off the wings of the butterfly&mdash;that furs
and feathers would almost seem to yield to the touch,
so nicely is the perception of their appearance preserved,
that one may well look with amazement, not
only at the marvellous tints themselves, which are
preserved to this day in all the brilliancy of their
pristine freshness and beauty, but also question as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
whether these effects were mostly attributable to the
skill of the artist, or to the quality of the body colours
themselves. Still, I am inclined to think, from general
observation and historic tradition, that the <i>secret</i> of
the chemical admixture of these pigments was as
much the individual secret of the artist himself, as
was his particular mode of executing his handiwork.
For it is reliably known, that the great Rubens, and
his predecessor Van Eyck, both Flemish artists, most
assiduously studied chemistry in Germany before they
applied themselves to painting; and that, to a great
extent, the brilliancy of their colours was owing to
their extensive knowledge of that science. If, therefore,
the "science of chemistry" was considered so
material a qualification in the mediæval painter, it is
not at all improbable, that the illuminator of the
period was actuated by the same motive to acquire
this knowledge, by which only his works could be
appreciated, as so much was depending on the quality
of his colours, to produce those mysterious and almost
miraculous effects, which the present age is still at a
loss to imitate. I am strengthened in this assumption
by the fact of having seen a curious old missal, in the
library and museum of the Hague, a few years ago,
attributed to Van Eyck (who is known, not only as
an illustrious painter, but also as a skilful illuminator),
in which is embodied an illumination representing a
studio, where the scribe is assiduously engaged on his

work, whilst an assistant is seen <i>grinding materials on
a stone slab</i>, and arranging them on a pallet, for the
use of the artist.</p>

<p>With work on hand, and, perhaps, with commissions
for years, is it too much to assume, that he
would never incur the additional trouble of preparing
his materials, were it not that the <i>secret</i> of his preparations
was his motive for so doing? This secret, I
contend, is lost to us, and with it the character of
these body-colours, which our present ones do not
equal. For instance, I ask the student and observer
to compare the delicacy and permanency of the <i>white
ornamentations</i> in the works of the older masters
with what our present <i>Chinese white</i> will effect.</p>

<p>Whether, in the present day, we can again produce
such glowing <i>scarlet</i> or brilliant <i>orange</i>, remains a
matter of doubt; but enough has been done already
to make us hope that much more may be expected,
in proportion as the attention of chemical science is
directed to the object, and the urgency of the illuminator
furnishes suggestions. I have come, however
to the conclusion, that with our present appliances,
we may make a tolerably good shift; and I recommend,
therefore, for general purposes of the art, the
"<span class="smcap">Illuminating Cake Colours</span>" as the best, and as
the safest (particularly to place in the hands of the
beginner). They are capable of being used with the
greatest facility, and can be worked up, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
happiest effect, in shading very minute ornamentations
or miniature paintings; and it would require more
than ordinary skill, and a vast amount of experience,
to handle "Moist Colours" equally well. How the
several writers on this art can recommend them, I
am totally at a loss to imagine. One colour manufacturer,
in his eagerness to go with the stream, has
actually produced an illuminating box with <i>Powder
Colours</i>. I advise the unlucky purchaser to lay them
by, to tint wax-flowers with, since, for the purposes of
illumination, they are totally useless. The <i>Cake
Colours</i>, from my own experience, are the only
means the illuminator has to rely on, in order to
give a soft tone to his work; and when mixed with
the <i>enamel white</i>, they form opaque tints, which even
then can be used with greater facility than when
compounded with Moist Colours.</p>

<p>Half a dozen only of the Moist Colours I recommend,
in addition to the Cakes, to produce finishing
effects in touching up, when all the subject has been
completed, or to use wholly for deep-tinted fruits or
flowers, such as cherries, currants, carnations, or
hearts'-ease, in which the rich, moist, purple carmine
will give the happiest and quickest effects. <i>Hooker's
green</i>, <i>carmine</i>, <i>burnt carmine</i>, <i>purple</i>, <i>burnt sienna</i>, and
<i>emerald green</i>, will be amply sufficient for this purpose.
In conclusion, I therefore warn the purchaser not to
be allured by the sounding title of an "<span class="smcap">Illuminating</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Colour-box</span>," though highly-priced and costly fitted
up, but to purchase that only which is likely and
capable of answering his purpose.</p>

<p>I must give the present age credit for having left
no means untried to supply the demand of suitable
materials for the purposes of illuminating, in the hope
of approaching, or even equalling, the effects displayed
in the missals of the middle ages; and, as these effects
vary in the originals, owing to different theories pursued
by different artists, so the present systems adopted
by various and eminent manufacturers in their present
<i>Illuminating Colours</i>, are apt also to produce <i>different
results</i>. We have then before us&mdash;<i>Powder</i>, <i>Moist</i>,
<i>Cake</i>, and recently again a new contrivance of
<i>Liquid Colours</i>, produced by a firm of eminent
repute, and which, from my own experience, are
certainly as <i>bright</i> and <i>brilliant</i> as one would wish
to see&mdash;each of these possesses merits useful in its
own way, <i>provided the skill of the Artist has been able
to seize on their adaptability</i>,&mdash;but placing each of
these four different kinds of colours in four equally
clever hands, there will be four distinct results; thus,
with our <i>present Moist</i> colours, we shall obtain (if we
wish to imitate that) the coarsest results of the earlier
productions of mediæval art, without their <i>brilliancy</i>,
looking heavy, and wanting the <i>transparency</i> so
charming in the better productions of the later Italian
style. The <i>Powder</i> colours again look transparent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
perhaps brilliant, but require great skill and <i>much</i>
manipulation, to keep the shading soft, and prevent
the <i>hard line</i>, where the colour unhappily was suffered
prematurely to dry; depth of tone, too, is out of the
question. The <i>Liquid</i> colour possesses brilliancy of
tint, a perfectly flat and even appearance like enamel,
depth of tone, and is most useful for flat illuminations
<i>where no shading is required</i>; transparency, however,
according to my present impressions, is wanting. <i>Cake</i>
colours, therefore, aided here and there by the adjuncts
of moist or liquid colours, as the nature of the work in
hand may suggest, are, in my opinion, the best medium
through which the higher qualities of finish, and the
general impression which those better and unapproachable
specimens of our best models leave on our
mind, can be attained.</p>

<p>Since brightness and effect are essentials in missal
painting, all the fault must not be laid at the door of
the colour-box, but frequently to the unskilful manner
in which they are used. It is astonishing the difference
which is perceptible in the drawings of one
artist and another. I have frequently had occasion
to ask my pupil where she obtained that orange or
this vermilion. "It is from your colour-box," would
be the reply, and whilst, in another instance, I
might find fault with a colour for being dingy and
impure, she might have been heard to answer, that
it was my own colour she had used. The fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
is thus quite clear, that one artist has better skill to
use the colours than another; and it requires a certain
knowledge and method to use them properly. From
my own experience, therefore, I will give explanations
how each colour should be used, for what applies to
one may be totally different in another. I shall,
therefore, commence with&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Ultramarine Blue</i>,</p>

<p>Which is a metallic colour of recent invention, and
chiefly manufactured in Germany. The best and
purest is prepared in France, and varies considerably
in price and quality. It forms one of the most essential
colours in illuminated painting, giving tone and
life to the whole, and forming a strong contrast
against any other bright colour; it should, however,
not be too predominant, but judiciously introduced.
It is manufactured without any component ingredient
which tends to affect its brightness, or its brilliant
depth. In combination with <i>enamel white</i> it can be
tempered to any shade, resembling the pure <i>ultramarine</i>
in tint, but of a brighter and less greenish
quality. It must be laid on very evenly, very rapidly,
and after once being painted in and yet moist, a full
brush must immediately be used, to let an additional
quantity freely and fully drop in; when dry, it will
be perfectly even and equally dispersed. Gold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
platina, or <i>enamel white</i> may form graceful ornamentations
over it, as also a deep black, which forms a
rich contrast against the ultramarine; particularly if
a bright spot of orange or carnation, such as a dot, is
introduced. The drawing of any ornamentation over
it should be done very finely, and with the finest
brush, so as to look delicate, artistic, and studiously
neat. The best mode of shading it is not with black,
but with deep carmine and a little gum arabic in
solution; it forms an intense purple, and is much
more effective than black.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Vermilion.</i></p>

<p>The vermilion, which at all times is difficult to obtain
very bright, requires to be laid on evenly and not <i>too</i>
thin; it should not be allowed to dry before the
intended space be completed, otherwise you obtain a
sharp edge. The brush should be moderately full,
but if too full, it will cause the colour to run towards
one point, and form a dark spot. Once is sufficient
to go over with the brush, if carmine ornamentations
are intended to embellish it; but when a bright red
only is intended, it would be better to paint over
twice, always taking care to let the first wash dry
first, before applying the colour a second time. Carmine
should always be used to shade or ornament it,
and if in some instances a deeper contrast is desirable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
add a little burnt carmine to it, where the
greatest amount of intensity is required. Never use
black to effect the object.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Emerald Green</i></p>

<p>Requires nearly the same treatment as vermilion,
with a little more care in washing in a second time,
since that colour is easily displaced by the second
time going over it, which would give it an uneven
appearance. The beauty of illuminated drawing is
greatly increased by the solid and even appearance
of the colours. If used faintly, it may be shaded
and ornamented with cobalt; if used intensely,
Hooker's green may be more effective; mixed with
a little cobalt, it forms a bluish green, frequently
introduced in drapery in the old missals. It is a
useful and effective adjunct in scrollwork, but should
not be used for the painting of natural leaves; they look
then as if cut from bright green paper, instead of
representing nature's variegated ornaments.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Cobalt Blue</i></p>

<p>Is used precisely as the emerald green. A thin and
even wash is most essential in the first place, to be
gradually tinted up with the same tint. A good deal
of patience and manipulation is necessary to smooth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
this most difficult colour into obedience. Young
beginners will find it most irksome to handle, but it
forms an agreeable variety amidst the other blues.
It looks well for skies in tiny landscapes, and may be
used for water, if copying the older missals, in which
it will be seen that water is always blue. White
ornamentations are used over it, to hide any
defects.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Purple</i></p>

<p>Is not a permanent colour, but being in combination
with another, it changes to a bluish tint; it is easily
applied, and very useful and rich in contrast with
orange, silver, or light colours in general. This colour
has been much esteemed, as preferable to the made-purple
of carmine and cobalt. It can be used for
backgrounds if intensely laid on, two or three times
over: it has almost the appearance of velvet, and
may be used with advantage in every shade, and
modified with a little burnt carmine to suit the taste
of the artist.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Orange Chrome</i></p>

<p>Is not so bright as the red lead, but is permanent,
and will not turn black. I have preserved all its
brightness that was possible to obtain, and have,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
therefore, entirely abandoned the more seductive red
lead: it is used precisely as the vermilion.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Chrome Lemon.</i></p>

<p>Requires no particular treatment; it is both permanent
and bright. We place it in the box to be occasionally
used for illuminations, where an opaque
colour is desirable. The gamboge can be used
instead, when a transparent colour is preferable, and
it will, in combination with prussian blue, form
beautiful greens for foliage.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Carmine</i>, <i>plain</i>, <i>burnt</i>, <i>and purple</i>.</p>

<p>Is one of the most useful colours in illuminations;
its richness, either diluted or not, gives life and
brilliancy to the surrounding colours. In combination
with enamel white, it makes a rich pink; with
cobalt, it forms a soft lilac; and with burnt carmine,
it produces a rich brown, and invariably adds to the
general effect. Carmine is so generally useful, so
easily applied, that the artist will soon discover its
inestimable value.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Hooker's Green</i></p>

<p>Is equally useful, brilliant, and easily applied. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
adds intensity to the shading of all the greens. In
combination with white, a beautiful middle tint is
obtained, and may be used for ornamentations,
scrollwork, etc.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Burnt Sienna</i></p>

<p>Is used with the greatest advantage in shading gold
or silver (particularly the former), intensified with
lamp-black. It is used in figure-drawing for the hair,
eyebrows, etc. In combination with burnt carmine
and lamp-black, it forms a rich brown for backgrounds,
and touches up foliage to much advantage.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Lamp-black</i></p>

<p>For its intensity, is preferable to Indian ink, and
is very effective for backgrounds. To add to its
intensity, you may mix a little gum arabic with it,
when required as a shadow on the same colour.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Middle Tints</i></p>

<p>Or opaque colours, which form so conspicuous a
feature in the old missals, such as pink, salmon, gray,
lilac, pale green, primrose, or pale blue, are severally
produced, by the addition of <i>enamel white</i> with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
following colours: carmine, vermilion,<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> black, cobalt
and carmine, Hooker's green, yellow and ultramarine,
in such proportion as the tint requires to be high or
faint; but care must be taken in laying these on
evenly to preserve an equal surface, which is easily
displaced by going over it a second time.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Enamel White</i></p>

<p>Forms a distinguished feature in illuminating; its
utility for various objects is apparent; a small dot,
the size of a pin's point, tells on the blue, red, pink,
or lilac with most delicate effect. It adds, also, a
brightness to the gold and on colours, when judiciously
applied. The artist can extensively avail
himself of it, and may modify its intensity as circumstances
require. It forms a <i>hard enamel</i> over the
gold size, which then may be painted over with gold
or silver from the shell; and when perfectly dry, may
be burnished richly over with the agate, and forms a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
bright gold or silver <i>raised</i> ornament. It aids him,
also, to repair any damage or imperfection which
may accidentally occur; and its general utility will
soon be discoverable, when the student begins to
advance in the art.</p>

<hr class="deco"/>

<p>With respect to other colours, not enumerated
here, they may be used as occasion requires; and
those acquainted with water-colour painting, can
apply them to the painting of flowers, landscapes,
miniatures, etc., in the same manner as on drawing-board.
The delicacy of vellum, however, is much
better fitted for the purposes of painting than either
ivory or paper; I need not add, that the most pleasing
and the highest finished drawing may be successfully
executed on it.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Platina and Silver.</i></p>

<p>I have adopted platina, or aluminium, in preference
to silver, since the two former retain their colour permanently,
whilst the silver generally discolours after
two or three weeks' exposure to the air. Those who
prefer the more brilliant colour of bright silver, can,
however, use it; gently washing it over with a soft
new brush dipped into spirits of wine (which, when
dry, forms a varnish over it), thus excluding atmospheric
air, and thereby effectually preventing discoloration.
Care should be taken that in the process
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the silver be not removed, by the brush being <i>too</i> dry
or too roughly used.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Green or Yellow Gold.</i></p>

<p>The application of the green gold forms also a pleasing
variety, amidst illuminations of yellow or matted gold,
and gives a richness to the design, entirely unknown
in the ancient missals, since its use at that period was
not discovered. For this reason, many of my orthodox
pupils have objected to use it, "because they could
not find it in the ancient manuscripts;" but whilst I
would encourage the study and close imitation of the
<i>style</i> of the ancient masters, as far as artistic principles
are concerned, I cannot object to the introduction of
any improvement in <span class="smcap">effect</span>, which modern art may
suggest, merely on the ground that our productions
should be slavishly imitative of the old originals.
For this reason, I also always discourage the introduction
of quaint and grotesque figures, mis-shapen
animals and monstrosities, imaginary flowers or fruits,
which never had existence, and which merely indicate
a want at the time of artistic knowledge of the real
beauties which are to be found in the productions of
nature, the want of which knowledge, taught them to
supply us with the defective creations of their untutored
imaginations. Of these, plenty of specimens
are found in the earlier productions of the sixth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
seventh centuries; they are, however, gradually improved
upon in the later productions. I prefer,
therefore, the pleasing consistency of representing
objects of accurate design, to such as, at the
present moment, would incur the ridicule and just
censure of the critic. Very little observation need
be made in the use of either gold, silver or platina,
since it is applied easily from the shell with a paintbrush
and clean water to the vellum, and can be
ornamented or burnished with the agate at pleasure,
or be painted over with blue, white, or red scrollwork.</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Agate</i></p>

<p>Is used, with a little practice, to great advantage,
and is capable of producing beautiful effects on the
shell gold. A large field of gold would look rather
monotonous; the agate is, therefore, employed for
engraving, as it were, little ornaments over it, of
various designs, which appear in bright contrast to
the dead gold. A steady hand is required to make
the scrollwork run smoothly and freely; a little dot,
or a cluster of them, a stalk producing little flowers,
and an indented rose-leaf or vine-leaf, with its arteries,
can also successfully be produced. It were
best, however, to practise this on a small scale first,
before progressing with the drawing in too great a
hurry. I entirely disagree with the use, under any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
circumstances, of any kind of <i>imitation</i> or <i>liquid gold</i>,
firstly, because its permanency is quite uncertain;
secondly, it is too coarse and brassy in appearance;
and lastly, the agate could not produce the delicate
tracings on its surface, as when applied to the <i>real</i>
shell gold.</p>

</span>
<span class="largecap">T</span>HE immense variety of styles adopted
formerly in illuminations, makes it
somewhat difficult to classify them in
this little volume; and I will, therefore,
confine myself to those which are the most
popular and the most admired. We have the
transparent border, with a profusion of scrollwork,
foliage, fruits, flowers, and insects, relieved by tre-foiled
ornamentations in raised gold, and the blank
spaces filled up with black filigree work, and which I
perform simply with the lead pencil.<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> The colours to be
arranged in such borders may be as varied as possible,
in proportion as the design consists of small and numerous
ornamentations. The contrast and variety
cannot here be too profuse, so long as they are made
with discretion. A predominance of too much blue,
or red, or green, becomes tiresome to the eye; and,
therefore, the greater number of varied tints introduced
the better. Avoid, above all, ugly colours. No olive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
greens or bad blues, but rich and decided tints; a
deep orange, a bright red, a clear purple&mdash;against a
soft pink, a delicate primrose, or a blushing carnation;
a sky blue against a deep bronze, or chocolate brown;
the gold between, and the silver, will divide the
monotony of effects; sameness will be avoided, and
yet unity preserved. The same rule does not apply
to the solid border, where the ornamentation is
formal and large, and conspicuously relieved by a
background of solid gold or colour. A profusion of
colours <i>then</i> would resemble the harlequin's coat of
many shreds and patches. Simplicity, to my mind, is
its greatest merit and recommendation. I have seen
the best effects produced by the simplest means, and
by two or three colours only. Much depends on
taste, everything on effect and sound judgment; and
if, in such class of design, the object must be attained
by the quantity of colours, it proves the poverty of
the artist's resources.</p>

<p>The partially solid border, which is a combination
of the first mentioned, consisting of square, or undulated
solid bands, with transparent background, should,
in character and combination of colours, be also
alike; modified, however, by the consideration of
these solid spaces, on which the ornamentation should
be simpler, and in good harmony against the colour
of the background. These backgrounds are in
various tints&mdash;the most common in use is gold; we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
have also crimson, ultramarine, purple, and not unfrequently
black. On all these, the taste of the illuminator
is called in to produce a good contrast in
the arrangement of colours, and the less confused by
quantity the better.</p>

<p>There is another style which I have adopted, and
which scrupulous antiquarians would not designate
as being strictly legitimate, in which the arrangements
and a profusion of contrasting colours, is allowable
and even desirable. I published the class of design
I allude to in the "Victoria Annual of 1844," the
originals of which are in Her Majesty's possession&mdash;the
chief attraction consists in the design of the
initial letter, and the first word of the poem or
subject, which is prominent at the head of the
drawing, enclosing the remaining text in a small
narrow framework, surrounded more or less by
elaborate scrolls, arabesques, medallions, etc., always
avoiding known and accepted mediæval ornamentations
from the old missals as much as possible, in
order not to mix the different styles in one drawing.
This style has found much favour with modern
artists, on account of its graceful effect, the absence
of conventional stiffness, and the rapidity with which
a composition may be arranged. <i>Legitimists</i> do not
like it from mere affectation; they would prefer crude,
ugly, misshapen ornamentation, flat and unfinished,
as long as it resembled a conventional style. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
the same reason they object to <i>green</i> gold, or agate
ornamentations; yet what can be more attractive
than the yellow and bright green gold in combination,
enriched by the artistic engravings of the agate?
What more gorgeous to the eye than a display of
graceful curves fantastically interwoven, enclosing
highly-finished medallions, and thrown up by all the
effects imagination and art can conjure up? Some of
these specimens may be seen at my own gallery, and
amongst them a rich specimen of a chess table which
figured at the Great Exhibition in 1851, and which occupied
me two years in painting. There are numerous
other styles; and even modern art illuminations may
be multiplied in an almost infinite variety; but the
experience in such as are above alluded to, will give
sufficient instruction, and regulate a classical and perfect
taste, under whatever circumstances afterwards
the pupil may be called upon to exercise his skill.</p>

<p>Within the last few weeks, I have designed and
published a Series of Outlines, called the "Beauties
of Shakespeare," illustrative of the poetical genius of
the great bard, in which the attempt has been made
to embody the poetical creations of the Poet in <i>vignette</i>
illustrations of the text, interwoven with suitable
ornamentations, light and aërial as the fleeting thoughts
of the Poet himself, unencumbered by formal <i>square</i>
borders, and avoiding all conventional ornamentations,
which, strictly speaking, belong to sacred art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
only. Six subjects from the "Tempest" form the
first series, in which the songs of Ariel are surrounded
by descriptive and pictorial illustrations of the text,
and the choice sentiments of the chief personages in
the play, such as "Prospero," "Ferdinand," and
"Caliban," are duly illustrated throughout the ornamentations
with pleasing and appropriate effect. Six
more subjects from the "Merchant of Venice," which
forms the second series, are treated similarly, and to
this, the more dramatic description of the text,
afforded a widely different opportunity in producing
totally distinct effects, by which <i>sameness</i> was entirely
avoided. Sufficient of ornament is, however, preserved
to throw in harmony and healthy contrast of
colour and gold, to keep it legitimately within the range
of "illuminated illustrations." Whether the modern
taste will encourage this attempt at innovation,&mdash;whether
it will attract the sympathies of a new school
of artists, or not,&mdash;or be condemned by the more
severe and uncompromising antiquarian, experience
and the success or failure of this publication will
prove; if successful, the boundless wealth to be found
in the pages of the illustrious dramatist, will afford
ample material to follow up this publication by similar
attempts in his other, and perhaps more popular
plays.</p>

<span class="largecap">W</span>HILST the student may profitably employ
himself in attempting minor trifles&mdash;initials,
copies of anything within
his reach, or his own ideas; to acquire
proficiency in the art, it is requisite to employ
a master to direct his taste on the one hand, and
to lead him on step by step to perfection, on the
other. It would be highly essential to him to study
the ancient missals, so as to enable him to distinguish
the progress the art has made in various countries and
in different ages. It is a field for deep research and
study, to note the different styles adopted at different
epochs, from the crude development of art of the fifth
and sixth centuries, to the refined and exquisite productions
of the Italian and Flemish schools of the
fourteenth century, and again down to the inferior
and flimsy style of Louis Quatorze. It is from the
study of these, that his own ideas will be developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and improved, and that his modern notions of beauty
and effect may be advantageously thrown in, to produce
original and classical productions, abandoning that
which is absurd and meaningless, and substituting
that which is rational, effective, and beautiful. The
pedantic absurdity of retaining any class of ornamentation,
solely because it was used in the early ages by
our ancestral predecessors, on account of their notions
of drawing and perspective being imperfect, is as
rational, as it would be for the vigorous offspring of a
lame parent to use crutches and insist on walking
lamely; and whilst we may justly admire the ingenuity
of their efforts in producing the historic records of
their skill, we may, at least, elevate our taste in improving
on that which plainly bears the stamp of their
imperfections. In composing a drawing, the student
should select the style of a certain period, to which
throughout he should strictly adhere, as the adoption
of different styles in the same drawing is both inconsistent,
and evinces bad taste; to mix up the Gothic
with the Louis Quatorze, or the Elizabethan with the
Italian style, would simply be absurd. The writing of
the text, the initial letters, the ornaments, costume,
armory, etc., all should partake of the corresponding
epoch. Illustrations also should be introduced according
to the subject, and the ornamentations be
also adapted to, and harmonize with, the whole.
If, for instance, it was determined on to illuminate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
the Creed or the Lord's Prayer, pictures might be introduced
illustrative of the lives of the Saviour and the
Apostles, historical and pictorial illustrations of the
Christian creed, etc. If a secular subject from Milton,
Shakespeare, or Byron, the same rule should be
adopted. The "Lines on a Skull" from Byron might
happily be illustrated with emblems of mortality,
whilst the numerous episodes to be gleaned from the
immortal pages of our great dramatist, Shakespeare,
furnish an almost inexhaustible spring of truth and
beauty, from which the young illuminator may draw his
subjects for illustration; great liberty being allowed for
embodying the imaginations of the poet with his own,
and affording ample opportunities and material for
the exercise of his inventive powers as an illustrator,
thereby evincing a decided stamp of reflective genius.
Above all, never attempt to illustrate a common-place
subject, or defective and puerile poetry; it is not
worth the pains of a single daub of colour.</p>

<p>In arranging a subject for illumination, I should
first draw my attention to the initial letter at the head
of the text. There are thousands of specimens in the
British Museum; and many publications of alphabets
are in existence, very useful for the beginner; these
may be varied, or strictly copied at pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> Colours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
may be changed, scrolls or foliage altered, taking care
that alterations are judiciously made, and really <i>improve</i>
the general effect. The initial letter being
settled on (which should, if possible, in some manner
bear on the subject-matter of the poem or episode),
I would recommend next, to write the text in old
English, or Church Text, each line being ruled-in
equi-distant, and the capitals left blank, to be painted
in afterwards; and where a word at the end of a
line is so short as not to fill up close to the margin
let the space be filled up with a small ornament
in some colour; where a word is to be prominent,
write it in gold, or red, or a different colour to
the general body of the text; when the writing
is completed, I would arrange the border, one side
of which may be double the width of the other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the bottom also wider than the top; if pictures are
to be introduced, sketch out a proper framework first
for their reception. These arrangements form the
groundwork of the drawing; scrollwork may then be
introduced, beginning at some corner, or springing
from the framework of the intended picture; when
that is nicely arranged, the same scroll might be repeated,
upwards or sideways by transferring the
tracings; the intervening spaces, if too naked, can be
filled up with flowers, taking care that, in the reduction
of the size of the flowers, they each shall preserve a
relative proportion to the other, equal to the scale to
which they are reduced; this is very essential. If
any insects are introduced, this rule should also be
observed. It would look very ridiculous that a butterfly,
fluttering over a rose, should be as large or
larger than the rose itself, or that a caterpillar should
assume the size of a conger eel in proportion to the
size of a heart's ease introduced in the same drawing;
one's natural judgment will suggest such faults as
absurd, and they should be avoided. If the border is
to remain transparent, lighter ornamentations may be
introduced to fill up the blanks; and finally, all the
white parts may be covered by thousands of little
dots, in colour and gold, taking care that in size and
distance they are all alike; this last process can be
effected either with the brush or fine steel pen, as best
suited to the ability of the pupil; if it should be determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
on to fill up the blanks with a solid background
of gold, the spaces need not be crowded too
profusely with small details, since the filling up of the
gold would become tedious. If solid, a white line of
equal distance may be preserved round every object
in the border: these lines should be drawn round
carefully first (not too wide), and afterwards filled up
solid. This white edging forms a very soft and
pleasing appearance in the drawing. If the gold is
closely to fill up against the scroll or flowers, you may
throw a strong shadow under it on the gold, by which
means the ornaments will appear to stand out in bold
relief, and be very effective, taking care that the
shadows are properly thrown on, and always according
to the strict rules of drawing.<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> The solid
part, instead of gold or silver, may also be made of a
light tint, such as a pink, or light blue, or deep purple,
or even black; in which case the same colours in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
deeper tint, with solution of gum arabic may be used,
this will throw up the shadow more perfectly; the
solid parts should then be scrolled over with close
and fine ornamentations of permanent white or gold
on the black background. As the varieties of effect
are so very numerous, I think it best to leave the
judgment of the pupil unfettered, to suggest the
varieties himself, or to consult the various specimens
in the manuscript room of the <i>British Museum</i>. A
very effective mode of painting pictorial illustrations
(known by the name of Cameo painting) may also be
resorted to, viz., to draw a subject for illustration or a
group of figures, all in <i>one</i> colour, including the background,
say blue, the outlines are given on the side
where the light falls, in gold; on the shaded side, with
a deeper blue, the lights are gradually tinted over
with gold, and the shadows shaded in with darker
blue. This mode of introducing pictures was very
prevalent in the Italian missals of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries; and I have seen them executed
in every colour, with very good effect.</p>

</span>
<span class="largecap">T</span>HE vellum (which should be the best
Italian, and prepared from the kid),
is of peculiarly fine and white texture,
different from parchment both in substance
and quality. I import it myself, and
previously prepare it for the artist, so that both
sides are equally good to receive the drawing upon.
Yet there is always a preferable side, which can
easily be distinguished: it is in reality the inside of
the skin, and has the smoothest appearance. The
price varies, according to the size, from 10<i>s.</i> to 3<i>l.</i>
the skin. Parchment of course is much cheaper,
and English vellum may also be had, but it does not
possess the beautiful and even quality of Italian. To
prepare it for drawing, it should be stretched on a
board made of good deal; the vellum should be cut
<i>larger</i> all round than the board, by about its thickness
(three-quarters of an inch), and sponged with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
perfectly clean sponge and water, on the side only
which is to lay against the board. When moderately
soaked, it should be laid between a fresh mangled
napkin for about five minutes, to let the vellum get
an equal moisture; the board is then placed on the
top, and the two corresponding sides are tightly
folded over, and resting it on the side, you begin to
nail from the centre, with small gimp-pins, till one
side is completed, each pin to be about one inch and
a half apart. You then do the same operation on
the other side, previously stretching it <i>slightly</i> and
<i>evenly</i> with the hand, and then again fixing the pin,
from the centre till the second side be completed.
You then again lay the board flat on the napkin, and
fold the two ends over as before, and complete the
stretching of the vellum in a similar manner. You
will then have only the back of the drawing-board
uncovered by the vellum. Let it gradually dry when
it will lie perfectly smooth and unwrinkled; and it
is then ready to work upon.</p>

</span>
<span class="largecap">I</span>F a copy is to be made of any illumination,
the easiest mode is by affixing
a piece of French tracing paper on the
back of the drawing, and throwing it
over the front; begin with a fine-pointed <span class="smcap">H H H</span>
pencil, to draw an accurate outline of the whole
thin, pale and delicate. Above all things, be <i>correct</i>;
do not trace <i>more</i> than is necessary for
your object, and avoid details, which may more easily
be put in by the eye. <i>Too much</i> tracing often confuses.
The <i>upper</i> and <i>inner</i> line of the hair, the eyebrows,
the line of the nose, the upper line of each eyelid,
the central line of the mouth, and the contour of
the cheek and chin, is sufficient to give a correct
tracing of a face; if you trace more, in retracing
it you will get confused. With ornamentations the
same rule applies; trace only as much as will
secure your object. When your tracing is complete,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
unfasten it, and attach it by two spots of
gum <i>to the back</i> of the drawing-board or vellum
prepared to receive it, and placing the <i>red prepared</i>
paper between it (with the prepared side towards
the board or vellum), you trace over it with the
same pencil (using a little pressure), and you then
obtain a fine, thin, delicate and faint red tracing
on the vellum. In this operation, in order to
work cleanly, the following rules must be observed.
You should use a fine H H H sharp-pointed pencil;
you should not press hard to make the transfer <i>too</i>
red, nor should your pencil-tracing in the first instance
be otherwise than <i>light</i>; it becomes deeper
when the pencil goes over it a second time, which
avoids the necessity of lifting up the paper, to
ascertain where you have or have not been over.
A good, correct and delicate transfer makes it pleasurable
to paint; a coarse deep red one gives the
artist an infinite deal of trouble, and the drawing
in this case will always look smeared and dirty,
which with a little attention can easily be avoided.
As the prepared red paper cannot always be easily
obtained, it is much easier to prepare it yourself,
which is done as follows: Purchase at the chemist's
a quarter of a pound of <i>red French chalk</i>, scrape
some with a table-knife on the thinnest <i>white</i> writing
paper you may have handy, and with a piece of
wadding rub it equally over the surface, taking care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
that the other side is kept perfectly clean; no grease
or water should be used in this operation. Should
a pencil tracing be preferred, blacklead may be used
instead of the chalk.</p>

</span>
<span class="largecap">T</span>HE raised gold ornaments, which form
so brilliant a relief, amidst the gaiety
and contrast of well-arranged colours
and matted gold, are subjects which
require a great deal of practice; they should be used,
therefore, sparingly at first, on account of their difficulty,
and they should always be introduced with great
judgment, since a profusion of bright ornamentations
distracts the eye from the main subject, and becomes
extremely vulgar, resembling much that <i>ginger bread</i>
appearance of the French class of tinsel and emptiness;
whilst a moderate use of them, here and there,
enriches the drawing, without their effect becoming
tiresome and destructive to the general beauties of
the drawing itself. They should, therefore, be limited
to small raised dots, or tre-foiled leaves only, a line
to form a bright shadow on the dead gold, or the
arteries on a leaf of green gold. They may also form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
a circle round a gem of ruby or emerald, representing
the setting or mounting of real gold, and such other
trifles as the subject may require. Water gold-size,
for the purpose of producing these raised ornaments,
is well calculated to effect this. The brown paste
contained in the little vessel is used in a similar
manner as a cake of water-colour, wetting it with a
sable brush, till of sufficient consistency, and painting
with it the desired ornament, and raising it by dropping
freely sufficient paste on it, which, by its own gravity,
will be properly rounded off, and becomes, when
properly set, fit to receive the gold leaf. It stands
then raised on the vellum, and may be increased <i>ad
libitum</i> by dropping more and more on it till sufficiently
high. In ten or fifteen minutes, at furthest,
when sufficiently set, cut a piece of gold leaf (always
a trifle larger than the object), and previously slightly
breathing on it, with the warm breath, place the cut
gold leaf on it, either with the point of a brush, or
clean scissors, or a pair of steel tongs made for the
purpose. The gold, being thus placed on the top, should
receive the warm breath again, and immediately it
will adhere firmly to the moistened matter: leave it
there for about one hour, when it will be properly
hardened; after which, with a soft clean piece of
wadding, rub it over, and the superfluous parts will
loosen easily, while those intended to be gilded will
remain. Should any part be imperfect, apply the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
paste again as before over the imperfect part, going
through the same process till complete. This, however,
will not occur when the pupil acquires sufficient
experience of the material with which he has to work.
Another mode of raised gilding, and one which, in
my opinion, is more expeditious and less troublesome,
is effected by my "Liquid Gold Cement," which is
used in a similar manner as the "Enamel White,"
and is partly composed of the same material, with
some slight addition. You dip the brush in the
bottle, and use it rather thinly at first, whilst
delineating the ornamentation, and afterwards
drop on it (whilst wet) as much of the same as the
brush will hold, till sufficiently <span class="smcap">raised</span>; in about
half an hour, being properly set, <span class="smcap">paint</span> over it, in
either colour, gold or silver, and when quite dry and
hard, let the same be burnished over <span class="smcap">gently</span> with the
<i>crooked</i> agate, and the ornament will stand brightly
out in the drawing; this mode I much prefer to
the former. There is still another and better method,
which I make use of in large and elaborate work, but
which I only can communicate to my pupils personally,
as it is a process that cannot possibly be
imparted in any other manner than by personal
superintendence and demonstration.</p>

</span>
<span class="largecap">H</span>AVING given a detailed explanation of
the mechanical means to be employed,
sufficient for the student to practise
the "beautiful art of missal painting,"
permit me to add a few words in conclusion, which I
hope will not be thought superfluous. Deeming it
essential to be as explicit as possible in the treatment
to be adopted, I have not left a single subject unnoticed,
which requires the attention of the learner.
The illustrations I have been enabled to give are
merely explanatory, but sufficient to help the pupil,
with some of the leading features observable in the
illuminations of the middle ages. For the purposes
of research, no other than the very originals ought to
be consulted, which lie within the reach of every one
to examine, at the <i>British Museum</i>. In that splendid
collection quite sufficient store will be found to furnish
the student with ample means of research, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the necessity of travelling on the continent, though,
no doubt, a great many gems of art are to be found in
the <span class="smcap">Vatican</span>, or the <span class="smcap">Royal Library at Paris</span>. But
in a collection so extensive as that in our own national
Museum, or the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge, we
can find sufficient to satisfy the most fastidious and
ardent lover of art. It is essential for the student to
study <i>originals</i>; and I have made it a practice to accompany
my pupils at least half-a-dozen times to the
manuscript rooms, during their course of instruction,
for the purpose of calling the attention to what to him
or her is essential to know, and to afford an opportunity
of making such extracts as afterwards may
usefully avail. They then can note down the progress
of art from age to age, and the gradual development
of decorative improvement, progressive with the advancement
of civilization; yet, strange to say, though
our own age claims to have reached that, in an
eminent degree, the decorative art, as indeed arts in
general, have not progressed in the same proportion;
how to account for this, is, not that art has arrived
at its climax of excellence; but that most of its
followers of the present age have contented themselves
by strictly admiring and <i>copying</i> the mediæval
artist, instead of exerting their own powers to excel
him.</p>

<p>Our age is too utilitarian. The artist now merely
toils to <i>live</i>; while, formerly, his ambition took a higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
flight; for then he laboured for <i>fame</i> and for <i>posterity</i>.
The artist, however, who does not solely paint for
<i>gain</i>, and who, from circumstances, is happily freed
from the trammels of poverty, should strive to excel
his predecessors. There is much room for improvement;
modern inventions have sprung up; mechanical
contrivances have advanced; new and interesting
objects of natural productions have been brought
within his reach, from the furthest limits of the
habitable globe, to enrich the resources of his inventive
powers, unknown to the antiquated monastic
scribes, to whom we owe so much. Our advantages
over them are obvious. Why, then, should we not
excel them? Let it not be considered that this art is
a mere mechanical amusement; a mere ingenious
contrivance; a daub of colours and gold&mdash;showy,
flimsy, and unmeaning. Though much of that exists
in our modern decorations, it is highly desirable that
it should not partake of that character; a little
taste, a little poetry, gracefulness, order, and some
display of general knowledge, of artistic combinations
and principles, cannot fail to make our productions
more valued and valuable. Give a tinge of some
originality,&mdash;display an attempt of your own inventive
powers, based upon acknowledged principles of beauty
and effect, and your productions will soon reach an
eminence of which art is ever capable! Though the
age of romance and chivalry has gone by, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
live now, strictly speaking, in that of sober reality,
our artistic productions may at least show that such
things have been, and may happily awaken a dream
of what life <i>once</i> was. The study of combination and
contrast of colours, affords him ample means to exercise
his taste; and the eye becomes instinctively
capable of discerning that which is graceful and
beautiful, and that which is not. But his task is
more severe than that of the painter, inasmuch as the
constant demand for new ideas and effects, is a
continual drain upon his inventive powers; the more
these are exercised, the more original his productions,
and the more likelihood there is of his excelling the
mediæval artists.</p>

<p>It is only within the last fifteen years, that the art
of illuminating has been newly revived: it has
slumbered for nearly two centuries in total oblivion.
I do not remember ever having seen an old missal in
my younger days; so little was it considered of importance
to the artist; yet what a store of information
may be obtained from them! What illustrations do
they furnish of the progress of the human mind and
of civilization! What light do they throw on the
manners, customs, and morals of bygone ages!
What links do they form in the gap of historical
events, which otherwise would have been left in darkness
for ever! There is scarcely a page, but on
which you may trace some interesting event connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
with the history of the period, its arts, its husbandry,
its revels, its glories, or its shame!</p>

<p>The application of <i>lithography</i> for purposes of
coloured printing or chromo-lithography in the last
fifteen years, has done much to awaken the attention
of the artist and the lovers of art to the treasures
mouldering in our libraries and museums; by its aid
we have been enabled to obtain copies and specimens
of illuminated printing, almost perfect facsimiles of
the originals. It has stimulated the artist to pursue
a new track for his operations; it has infused a corresponding
taste in the public mind for ornamental
improvement, which has manifested itself in every
branch of manufacture. The interior decorations of
the House of Lords afford a striking proof. A
century ago, when pigtails and cocked hats were the
fashion, such a gorgeous display of ornamental grandeur
would not, and <i>could</i> not, have been suggested.</p>

<p>The religious associations which suggest themselves
in the study of the old missals, is an element which
has proved itself sufficiently powerful to our present
generation, as to induce a spirit for its revival. The
English as a nation (to its credit be it said) is a truly
religious one. As a sacred art, then, it is alike reconcilable
with their devotional habits on the one hand,
and their indefatigable industry on the other, not
to grudge some spare time, to its alluring attractiveness.
English ladies, of the highest rank, even, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
each of their hours apportioned out to some useful
object. This art now takes a distinguished place
amongst them, and claims a great share of their solicitude,
as it affords them calm and sacred thoughts
to dwell upon, and ways that may be described, in the
language of the Proverbs, as "ways of pleasantness
and paths of peace," and that, which is anything
but frivolous or worldly&mdash;divested from the <i>pictorial</i>
and <i>symbolical</i> emblems of the Romish Church&mdash;the
art has enough left of holy associations, to
make it harmonise with the feelings of the Protestant
profession of faith without being offensive. Those
possessed of sterner religious scruples can fly to the
secular illustration of the poets. Our literature, so
rich and so eminently descriptive, opens a wide field
for the followers of this art to indulge in, thus creating
another field for the artist's genius equally imaginative
and interesting. Tennyson's, Longfellow's, or
Moore's pages are abundantly fertile in images of
beauty, to single them out as <i>fittest</i> for the modern
illuminator. All that is required (for the interest of
the art) is the formation of a <i>good school</i>. <span class="smcap">The Illuminating
Art Union of London</span> has made a
laudable attempt to establish this; its annual exhibition
opens the door and invites the public to
co-operate, not so much by pecuniary support as by
the aid of their contributions. Those who have the
ability, and have already gained their laurels, should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
set the example; it will add much to their <i>popularity</i>,
and not diminish one jot of that fame their talents
have already achieved. <span class="smcap">True art</span> should not be
selfish. Monopoly in art, as in corn, affects the food
for the mind, as in the latter, it affects that of the
body. That society, happily, is not exclusive. Though
supported by the highest in the land, it co-operates
with the humblest in one common labour and one
common object. <i>Rank</i> is forgotten, so long as their
association with their fellow-labourers tends to humanize
the masses, which, through the means of a
<i>sacred art</i>, is so easily effected. That its labours may
be successful, that its hopes may be realized, the
strenuous efforts of its promoters, and their persevering
exertions, are ample guarantees that the interest
of those sanguine in its success is amply secured.</p>

<p>The International Exhibition of 1862 (notwithstanding
the factious outcry against the unfortunate
building, and its hapless Architect), was conspicuously
successful, on account of the marked advance
Industrial Art had made, not only in the produce of
foreign Exhibitors, but mostly so in that of our
English artizans, as compared with that of 1851 in
Hyde Park. As far as English Industry and skill
was concerned&mdash;it left its unmistakable traces behind,
that since our first exhibition, when England
entered the lists with foreign competitors, it had at the
latter attained a miraculous improvement in <i>design</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
which no doubt was owing to a more extended and
systematical culture, and to which, the numerous
"Schools of Design" now established throughout the
kingdom gave rise. This improvement was so perceptible
by our neighbours, that even recently a celebrated
and well known French statesmen and political
economist, has not scrupled to express his fears "that
our English manufacturers had made such progress,
that sooner or later they would displace the foreign
producer, and monopolize the markets of the world!"
And will it now be believed, that unquestionable as
it is, that this improvement is entirely due to the
more extended cultivation of <i>Ornamental Art</i> in this
country&mdash;that the Royal Commissioners of 1862,
with all their collective wisdom, with their enlarged
views and former experience, and with the valuable
aid of highly gifted men in all departments of Science
to guide their councils, should have been short-sighted
enough, peremptorily to refuse admission
to any works of illumination, or decorative Art,
on the meagre pretence that there was <i>no space</i> available
for such works, which in 1851, however, were
deemed of sufficient importance, and to have exercised
such influence on Art manufactures in general,
not only to admit them freely, but to award several
first-class medals, to Artists, who then even enjoyed a
European reputation! (Vide report of the Exhibition
of 1851). All remonstrance which could have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
urged by me, against such suicidal an Act, was cut
short by the curt and <i>red tape</i> reply&mdash;"that the Royal
Commissioners having once determined on any point
there was no appeal from their decision."&mdash;This
closed a vexatious correspondence in December,
1861, and it was not till the following April, a short
month previous to the opening of the world's fair
at Kensington, that among the arrivals of some
productions from Japan, one I particularly noticed to
consist of an "Historical Biography," a specimen of
curious Caligraphy, and embellished with artistic
illuminated borders in gold and colours. It was then
that I ventured to address an earnest protest against
this unseemly partiality to a gentleman high in office,
and well known for his well earned reputation,
gained in connection with the success of the first
exhibition, and to his honour, be it said, immediately
on receipt of my letter, he placed himself in
communication with the "National Board of Education,"
and had influence enough to reverse the
decision which the Royal Commissioners previously
had arrived at. <i>Space</i> was then granted (almost unlimited)
for the reception of Missals and Modern
Illuminations. I managed by great persuasion to
induce the members of the "Illuminating Art Union
of London," to send what specimens they hastily
could gather together, and some fifty subjects of more
or less merit were hurried to the building, and placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
without order, without classification, in the gallery next
the great dome, amongst the Architectural designs&mdash;perhaps
some thirty more from private sources,
amongst which were specimens from Owen Jones,
Audsley and others, were the joint and meagre contributions,
which the International Exhibition of 1862
received within its walls. Unprepared and without any
special object, there was not a single contributor who
deserved or could lay claim to any attention from the
thousands who daily visited the building. I believe the
<i>wax dolls and sewing machines</i> gained more notoriety.
Unhonoured and tacitly admitted, we were ignominiously
buried in a corner&mdash;the whole collection
as representing the illuminating talent of this country
was a miserable failure&mdash;one solitary specimen, a
beautiful little prayer book in the Austrian Court, a
gem of high Art of modern Illumination was worth
seeing, and worth more, as a work of Art, than all
the combined skill displayed in the <i>corner</i> of the
Architectural Gallery. Who was to blame for this
egregious failure? Is it to be laid at the door of our
own Artists, or to the mistaken judgment of those who
had the nation's interest so much at heart and who
deprived us for six months of the opportunity of preparing
something specially for the occasion? Has
illuminating done nothing for the manufactures of
this country? Ask Bookbinders, Silkweavers, Architects,
Sculptors, Decorators, and every handicraft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
besides, in which decoration forms its chief ingredient&mdash;ask
the "School of Design" whether the
inspiration of its latent genius, was not derived from
the impetus modern illumination has given to decorative
Art in general. Is it a fair standard of what
English skill might have accomplished, to judge it by
the miserable refuse of stale bits of <i>tinsel</i> and <i>text-writing</i>
which was exhibited there? No wonder that
in all the elaborate reports which daily appeared in
the "Times," not a single line was penned to the
Art Illuminations of 1862&mdash;it is to be hoped that
the opportunity thus lost may not be fatal to the
further development of an Art, which has and still
exercises such beneficial influences on our Art manufactures
and civilization.</p>

<span class="largecap">I</span>N my first edition, in 1850, I suggested the
publication of classical outline borders,
which I only carried out in 1856, when
my second edition made its appearance;
the first part of six outlines, royal quarto,
was then produced to try how far the public would
appreciate their usefulness. The first attempt proved
a decided failure; they remained unsold, because
the uninitiated did not know how to apply them,
having no model for their guidance. I then tried
them with a small fragment, illuminated-in by hand,
which, in all cases, forms a complete key as to the
effect intended to be produced in the whole remaining
border. This met with a decided success; the
public eagerly purchased these partially illuminated
outlines; and very seldom any plain subjects afterwards
were asked for. The demand has ever since
become so extensive, that upwards of four hundred
different subjects have now been published, some
forming complete works in themselves, such as the
119th Psalm (twenty-four subjects) published by Messrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Longman and Co.; and its companion, the "Sermon
on the Mount," "The Beatitudes," etc., on the illumination
of which a large staff of lady artists are
always employed. My most anxious care was then
directed as to the <i>choice of subjects</i>, but above all
in the selection of the <i>designs</i> themselves. If, by an
extensive sale, I found myself amply rewarded, I
conscientiously felt also the importance, that the
public should receive none but choice and classical
models, from which they could study with advantage.
I was less ambitious to furnish them with original
ideas of my own, than to illustrate those various
styles and periods of art, which would have a
tendency to general improvement, and were likely
to cause a more healthy taste in the beginner. I
therefore carefully selected models from the best
specimens in the libraries of Paris, Brussels, Heidelberg,
and Amsterdam, besides those to be found in
our own Museum, and the Bodleian library, Oxford,
and which, with important alterations, I found adaptable
for my object. I attempted to illustrate subjects
from the <i>seventh</i> to the <i>fifteenth</i> century&mdash;from the
<i>Byzantine</i>, <i>Anglo-Saxon</i>, <i>Flemish</i>, and <i>Italian schools</i>,
which should form a complete grammar of ornamental
art, from which the student might learn
something better than to daub in a worthless or a
meaningless design. I abandoned all pictorial illustrations
(in the sacred subjects at all events) which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
could in the slightest degree be considered as sectarian,
or partaking of partiality for any particular
religious denomination; all my aim was directed, that
the ornamental border should be applicable to the
subject and highly artistic, in order to be perfectly
and usefully instructive. To pervert the taste, then,
by producing decidedly ill-conceived ideas, in the
shape of outlines, which any <i>sign-painter</i> might
produce with equally good success, I conscientiously
opposed. As a stepping-stone towards achieving better
things my method only is defensible, as an attempt
to awaken the taste of the beginner, which afterwards
may tend to develop originality in him; how
inexcusable, then, to place rubbish in his hand for
the mere purposes of gain. I am sorry my unscrupulous
imitators are differing from me; and I am
more sorry that a man, whose genius as an illuminator
is of European repute, should have been
found <i>really capable</i> to endorse with his authoritative
approval, the worthless productions of a <i>trading publisher</i>
as "most useful models," and insert that statement
in one of the most <i>valuable publications</i> on
the art of illuminating hitherto published. To put
the public on its guard, both as to the <i>malproductions</i>
themselves, as well as to the <i>opinions</i> thus promulgated
with so much appearance of honest "criticism,"
and industriously paraded forth in the trade-lists of
the speculative publisher, has been my principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
motive for introducing this subject into the present
volume; as I feel too much interest in the pursuit,
not to denounce the worthlessness of these publications,
which can only tend to injure a beautiful art.
I introduced my outlines with the deliberate object
of directing the taste towards the development of a
highly pleasing and instructive accomplishment, the
interest of which is daily gaining ground with the
public, and to lessen the difficulties which surround
the illuminator as much as possible; for this purpose
I took away from him the responsibility of forming
his design, for which his inexperience was not fitted.
I left him enough to do, in <i>arranging</i> his colours and
producing his <i>effects</i>. It was only when the <i>outline</i>
was illuminated, that he could appreciate the beauties
of the <i>design</i>; and it is from that appreciation,
that his own ideas would become sufficiently matured
to <i>invent one</i> of his own. The effect of this truism
was amply demonstrated in the fact, that one of my
distinguished lady pupils, who for a year had practised
on these examples, was successful enough two years
ago to carry away the "first prize" for the best original
design of the "Beatitudes," awarded to her by the
<span class="smcap">Illuminating Art Union of London</span>; on the
merits of which Messrs. <span class="smcap">Owen Jones</span> and <span class="smcap">H. Noel
Humphries</span> gave their valuable decision. <i>Had she
studied from modern and meaningless models, her
beautiful Italian border would never have been the result.</i></p>

<span class="smaller">APPENDIX.</span></h2>
</div>

<h4>PLATE I.</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span>,</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">
<img src="images/i_b_083_a.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt="" />
</span>
<span class="largecap">A</span> THIN border, very frequently used in illuminating
by the <i>Italians</i>; consisting of small blue and pink
spaces, ornamented with white lacework over the
flat ground.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span>,</p>

<p>Are specimens of various flowers, ornamentations, foliage,
the arabesque scroll, etc., which are to be met with in the
ancient manuscripts. To give anything like a variety, would fill
a volume; to classify them would also be an endless task, since
any contrivance to do so would be fruitless: my object being
to give an insight to some of the <i>leading</i> features observable in
the illuminations: these are sufficient for the beginner. To
acquire an accurate idea, I must refer the student to the
<i>British Museum</i>. I have given here outlines of subjects most
frequently met with; these the student can fill up with colours
according to his taste, varying them at pleasure; yet, in preference,
he should endeavour to sketch them himself, since it is
desirable that he should acquire proficiency in these trifles, for
as they generally form small details, to relieve the solid parts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
and are intended to fill up blanks, they invariably require to be
well executed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span>,</p>

<p>Are compartments to be filled up by various solid colours over
which the scrollwork or ornaments are applied, either in white,
gold, or colours; when in red, it is called <i>damask-work</i>, the
patterns of which can be varied in endless variety. Over the
gold, engravings with the agate are highly effective, sometimes
forming simple ornamentations, or representing embossed
chasing.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4</span>,</p>

<p>Represents a portion of a scroll to be filled in by a solid colour,
over which, after being properly shaded, fine threads of gold
may be drawn, or thinly dotted in white. In making these or
similar scrolls, care should be taken that they are gracefully
drawn, and made to run <i>freely</i> throughout the design.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5</span>,</p>

<p>Illustrates fragments of curves with leaves or ornaments which
must be ruled-in with the <i>ruling-pen</i>, by the aid of the wooden
scroll, the scroll being placed on the pencil-tracing, where a
portion of its curve corresponds with the intended design.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6</span>,</p>

<p>Are two straight lines ruled parallel and closely together, so as
to show a white thread between.</p>

<h4>PLATE II,</h4>

<p>Is the initial letter O, copied from a woodcut. Though the
general design is effective and pleasing, it is not accurately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
drawn; whereas it might have been, had the designer used the
tracing-paper. I have shown the defects in the outline, to illustrate
a principle which should be always avoided, viz., disregard
for the mechanical appliances, by means of repetition always at
hand for the illuminator by using the red transfer paper.</p>

<p>This initial is very useful to copy frequently, since it will
give freedom to the hand in producing graceful curves. The
remaining figures on this plate are various initials, used at the
head of texts; they may be variously illuminated.</p>

<h4>PLATE III,</h4>

<p>Is an early specimen of <i>Byzantine</i> art, about the eighth century,
the principle of the Irish school being here adopted, on which
the acanthus foliage of the <i>Roman</i> style is superadded. Some
gorgeous specimens of this style are in most of the European
libraries; but many valuable specimens of that period must
have been lost, since the <i>Iconoclastic fanatics</i> destroyed so many
thousands by the flames, from the end of the fifth to the seventh
centuries.</p>

<h4>PLATE IV,</h4>

<p>Is a specimen of a style of illuminating much in use from
the thirteenth century to the beginning of the fourteenth.
Many and very varied specimens of this style are in almost every
collection in European libraries. Sometimes the bands are
alternately solid and transparent; in others, the bands assume a
lozenge-fashioned, undulated, or circular shape; but another
and more frequently adopted mode is to alternate them, tints,
of <i>solid coloured bands</i>, keeping up strict regard as to complement
of colour. The following order may be regarded as a
lesson:&mdash;<i>Crimson</i>, <i>gold</i>, <i>ultramarine</i>, and <i>buff</i> may succeed each
other. The ornamentations show best on them when relieved,
by placing "casting shadows" under the flowers, scrolls, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<h4>PLATE V,</h4>

<p>Is an Italian border of the fourteenth century. The stems of
the scrollwork may be, with good effect, painted in gold, and
shaded up in burnt sienna, to imitate the bark of trees. Scrolls
and foliage may be painted in this specimen in delicate tinted
colours, such as greys, light blues, or pinks, softly shaded up,
and ornamented with white or gold ornamentations, according
to the circumstance of the tint selected. Flowers and leaves, of
course, in their natural colours. Various, and always delicate
tints for greens in leaves, are essentials in the old Italian border.
The "back-ground" here is intended to be gold, though other
tints may be substituted, so long as they are not introduced in
the ornamentations.</p>

<h4>PLATE VI,</h4>

<p>Is a border, to be found in almost every contemporaneous school
of the period&mdash;the French, the Flemish, the Italian, as well as
English and Irish. The ornamentations are not so softly executed,
nor is the outline as graceful as in the former. The
back-ground is always transparent, containing, sometimes, small
figured filigree work. A preponderance of one pervading colour
is sometimes its characteristic; but too much similarity in tint
should be carefully avoided.</p>

<h4>PLATE VII,</h4>

<p>Is the same style precisely as above, with the peculiarity of the
ornamentation springing from the immediate border surrounding
the text. The grotesque animal, twining itself in a curious
manner, is also typical of the illuminations of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<h4>PLATE VIII.</h4>

<p class="center">"THE MODEL OUTLINE."</p>

<p>I have ventured to give a specimen of a modern style of illumination,
based upon <i>no principle</i> whatever which could furnish
the student with any instructive hints, or enable him to produce
original ideas of his own. As a whole, it represents snatches
of ornamentations, jumbled together without order or arrangement,
and vanishing at both ends into space.</p>

<p>Scrollwork, having neither <i>beginning</i>, <i>middle</i>, or <i>termination</i>,
and presenting a series of flourishes, which may be said to give
this class of outline a distinctive character, under the generic
title of <i>Sign-boarding</i>. It is an attempt at imitating missal,
bearing about the same relation to its prototype as the
modern to the pure Gothic in architecture, or the ancient Rome
of Augustus to that of the present day in civilisation.</p>

<p>The great demand made for Outlines by the daily increase of
the chaste and beautiful Art of Illuminating, originally induced
their publication by Mr. De Lara, and, although he has numerous
imitators he confidently recommends them to the notice of the Public,
both as aids and instructors in the study of Missal Painting;
every care having been taken faithfully to reproduce for the Student's
enlightenment, adaptations of the style of the best and purest Masters.</p>

<p>The necessity for improvements to be made in the Ordinary Water Colours,

Mr. <span class="smcap">de Lara</span> to give the Subject his most earnest and careful attention, and as
a result, they have acquired a reputation for the richness and brilliancy of their
Tints, surpassing even those manufactured in Paris; and their peculiar fitness when

respects, to be unrivalled.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h2>FOOTNOTES:</h2>
<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="label">[A]</a> <i>Vide</i> list of materials at the end of the book.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_B" id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="label">[B]</a> A contemporary has asserted, that "vermilion" and "white"
should not be mixed; he says: "The vermilion must not be
mixed with white, or it will lose its brilliancy, and become a
colour like brickdust." I know not what vermilion or white
he used to induce him to come to this conclusion, but, after an
experience of many years, I assert, that if the proper illuminating
colours are used, they will, in combination, form that
beautiful "<i>salmon tint</i>," so frequently to be found in the old
missals.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_C" id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="label">[C]</a> Or with one of Gillott's fine Lithographic Pens.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_D" id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="label">[D]</a> I have prepared a variety of drawings of initial letters, and
classical borders both on vellum and cardboard, with <i>accompanying
outlines</i> of the same, very faintly lithographed, on super-fine drawing-boards which may be purchased for a trifling expense
at most art repositories and booksellers. The illuminations
may <i>also be purchased, or are lent on hire</i>, for the purposes of
copying. These are executed under my direction and superintendence,
by my numerous pupils, who now follow out the art
as a lucrative profession. As the student will obtain better and
more accurate ideas of copying from <i>drawings</i> than from <i>prints</i>,
I have, at the suggestion of many of my friends, adopted this
plan of supplying the amateur artist with an illuminated copy,
and its <i>outline</i>, which he may <i>easily</i> fill up according to his own
taste, or strictly follow the original: the encouragement this
suggestion has received from the public has tended to confer
a great boon on a worthy class of female artists, who have
been zealous and successful in a beautiful branch of female
accomplishment.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_E" id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="label">[E]</a> Some eminent writer on "ornamental art" strongly objects
to introduce "casting shadows" in ornamentations, or in other
words bringing out objects in "relief,"&mdash;he argues, with some
apparent plausibility, that if treading on a carpet, where flowers
or scrollwork were introduced, he should be afraid of crushing
the flowers, or stumbling over the ornamentations. I know not
which to admire most, the pedantry of modern philosophy on
art, or the actual beauty displayed in the "Old Missals," in
which these charming "casting shadows" present such bewitching
reality to the imagination. I leave the question to be answered
by the untutored beholder, without venturing on any theory of
my own.</p>
